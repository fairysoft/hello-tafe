# The Humble Readme File
**Introduction**

So it turns out the simple README file is not so simple after all.

**Readme.txt**

Readme.txt has been used since forever and packaged with software. Remember opening sick readme's with cool ascii art?

**Readme.md**

When Github became sentient in the year 2020, it forced everyone to edit their readme files using markdown language (hence the md). Markdown is used on Github, Reddit, and many other hip and trendy sites. It's like HTML's (markup language) benevolent twin brother, because its 99% simpler. You could even read the source code, it look's quite neat.

**What is the point of this?**

If I'm going to distribute technical documents as a readme on a github page, It's extra effort, but I will learn some github, and I will finally know how to write neatly on reddit as well.

* Using github for distribution is an industry norm
* Since distribution is through github, and they want readme.md, we sort of have to do it
* Github markdown has rules, it makes readmes standard
* Style Sheet's are still used, but because you have less options for fancy flair using this standard method makes everyone's life easier.
* Just look at how clean this is!

**Conclusion**

I just taught myself, markdown, that simple. I used markdown edit.
